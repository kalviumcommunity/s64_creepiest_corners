Project Title:
"The Creepiest Corners: User-Specific Collections of Internet Oddities" 

---

Project Summary:
Curation of the most weird and inexplicable things that the Internet has to offer on a personalized platform, presenting lists that fit one's own browsing. A user logs in to browse creepy videos, bizarre urban legends, crime-infested websites, or really just any kind of phenomenon that has puzzled our curious minds. The lists will be auto-generated according to the preferences or past interactions of the user in order to create a compelling experience and element of fearness. The goal of the project is to entertain and arouse curiosity with respect to strange digital corners.

**Why this Project:** 
This project is interesting because it brings together creativity and technology, which is something of universal interest to people, the strange and mysterious. It is also trying to add some value by getting users engaged in the community through common special interests for internet oddities. Essentially, through working on it, and upon successful completion, I'm aiming to know how to integrate more engaging highs into a platform.
